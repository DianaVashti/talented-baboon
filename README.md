Repo for Issue #96 Specs for understanding relational databases

Work through database exercises on LeetCode and HackerRank to build foundational knowledge for working with relational databases.

Run your responses against the automated test suites provided by LeetCode and HackerRank while using SQL reference materials to construct your answers.

Work on a subset of "Easy" and "Medium" level problems in different domains, including:

Relational Algebra
Indexes
Set Theory
Querying NoSQL and XML datastores
Database Normalization
SQL query construction
Context

Foundational knowledge for working with relational databases is important if you are creating or maintaining web applications with persistent storage. Sometimes to overhead of learning how to use a new SQL client or an ORM like Sequelize detracts from learning these foundational concepts. This project provides the opportunity to focus on this core knowledge so working with SQL clients and ORMs will be easier in a 'real-world' environment.
